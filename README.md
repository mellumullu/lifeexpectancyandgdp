Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis

This project aims to explore and analyze the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across six nations over time. By examining historical data, we seek to understand how these two key indicators of a country's well-being have evolved and whether they are correlated.

The primary objectives of this analysis are to answer the following questions:

- Life Expectancy Trends: Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- GDP Growth: Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- GDP and Life Expectancy Correlation: Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- Average Life Expectancy: What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
- Life Expectancy Distribution: What is the distribution of life expectancy across these nations?

Data and Methodology

Data Sources: The analysis is based on historical GDP and life expectancy data for six nations. The data is cleaned, explored, and visualized to uncover trends and correlations.

Analysis Tools:

- Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations that effectively communicate the findings.
- Jupyter Notebook: To document and share the analysis in an interactive format.

Results and Insights

Through this project, you will gain insights into the economic and health trends of these six nations, including how life expectancy and GDP have evolved over time and whether there is a significant relationship between the two.
